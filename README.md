# AI-Powered Student Guidance System

## Project Overview
Navigating the college experience can be daunting, especially for incoming students who are unfamiliar with the complexities of higher education. Our mission is to empower these learners by providing an AI-powered guidance system that helps them explore their academic interests, get involved in campus communities, and access resources to improve their chances of career success.

## Key Features
- **Academic Interest Exploration**: The AI system analyzes a student's academic background, preferences, and goals to recommend relevant majors, minors, and courses that align with their interests and aspirations.

- **Campus Engagement**: Using data on student organizations, clubs, and extracurricular activities, the tool suggests personalized opportunities for students to get involved and connect with like-minded peers.

- **Career Preparation**: The AI model identifies skills, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities that can help students develop the competencies needed to thrive in their desired career paths.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: By continuously gathering data on a student's academic progress, interests, and involvement, the system provides dynamic, tailored recommendations to support their ongoing growth and development.

## Benefits
- **Seamless Transition**: The AI-Powered Student Guidance System helps incoming students navigate the college landscape with confidence, reducing the learning curve and increasing their chances of success.

- **Engaged Learners**: By fostering connections with campus communities and providing access to relevant resources, the tool encourages active engagement in the educational experience.

- **Improved Outcomes**: Increased exposure to career-oriented skills and opportunities can lead to better academic performance, higher graduation rates, and improved job prospects for students.

- **Streamlined Support**: The AI system centralizes information and recommendations, making it easier for students to access the support they need to thrive throughout their college journey.

## Next steps
> Our plans for the future of this product

- We originally set out to make something that students can use as a companion that will guide them not only through their academics but their professional careers as well.
  - We want this to be a dynamically changing tool they can use as they improve and grow. We want it to grow with them.
- We want to later include functionality that will dynamically create a portfolio website for the student based on the classes they take, skills they accrue, clubs they're involved in, and jobs they hold.
   - Given the opportunity to further develop it we'd like this product to pull information about they're club and job involvement via a web of connected accounts like LinkedIn and Sun Devil Sync where we can capture information about extracurriculars and professional opportunities they're pursuing so their website can be best tailored to their growing resume.
